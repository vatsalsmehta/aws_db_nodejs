A simple nodejs server that shows how can one perform crud operations via nodejs with Aws Dynamodb.

Here we use docClient for the same. We add a simple item to the db

We have performed the following operations:
Add a record to Database inside function addItemToDB
Get a record from Database inside function getItemFromDb
